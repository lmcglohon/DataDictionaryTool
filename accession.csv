Graphite and pen were used to write the diary entries while pen and crayon were used to create the sketches. <br> 
Titled on first page as Bluemner’s “First [Painting] Diary.”  Diary entries are in English and German.  Many of the entries are Bluemner’s observations about his works of art or painting in general, such as “…one must take care to keep pigments and mixture pure on the palette, on the brush, on the canvas….” (p. 1) or “do not put on color unless it is done with full feeling” (p. 37). Other entries include a list of “oil colors on hand” with an enclosed sample sheet of the colors, a list of watercolors, and an inventory of objects with prices.  <br>
There are many small (approx 3 x 4 cm) black and white sketches dispersed throughout the diary entries.  Other sketches were completed on separate sheets of paper and attached to the versos of the diary pages.  These include 13 black and white sketches with color notations, ranging in size from 13 x 9 cm. to 21 x 25 cm., and six colored sketches, measuring 11 x 16 cm. to 17 x 21 cm.   The sketches are of countryside and landscape scenes, many include houses, trees, rolling hills and one sketch features a bridge over a river.
